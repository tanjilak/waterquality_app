# Smart Water Quality Monitoring App

This is a real time water quality tracking application. It can connect to a database that has real time water data stored inside. This was completed for a 2021-2022 Capstone course.

## Overview

### This Project

Users should be able to:

- Sign up and sign in for their own profile
- Connect to an Arduino device
- See real time data for pH, Temperature, and ORP values for water flowing out of a sink
- Sign out and have their information saved
- See predicted values for the next week (using LSTM for the machine learning algorithm)

### Application Layout

The GUI interface of the application is displayed below <br/>

## My Process

### Built with

- Flutter/Dart
- Firebase
- MYSQL/phpMyAdmin
- PHP

### What I Learned

I gained a wide understanding of Flutter and Dart syntax. I was introduced to multiple OOP concepts during this project. <br/> 

Connecting to a database was very confusing for me, at least from the beginning. <br/>

I was able to understand SQL commands to connect to php files and even inserted new data into tables. I acquired a knowledge on how to analyze and organize the data.  <br/>

My understanding of programming and problem solving improved when I was faced with coding errors. 

### Continued Development

For future projects, I would love to get a better understanding of SQL and analyzing more of the data. Incorporating more SQL techniques for the database would improve the application. <br/>

I would also try to use different application languages. Next time, I might use React Native or Xcode instead of Flutter for a better understanding of mobile applications.
